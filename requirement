Create a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) python text processing server with Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming capabilities that implements advanced text manipulation operations including intelligent text splitting with customizable delimiters and regex patterns, sophisticated find-and-replace functionality with support for regular expressions and case-insensitive matching, fuzzy text deletion using similarity algorithms like Levenshtein distance and semantic matching, and robust query-based text search with support for exact matches, partial matches, wildcard patterns, and natural language queries, while providing real-time progress updates and results streaming through SSE connections with proper error handling, connection management, and configurable processing parameters for batch operations on large text datasets.
